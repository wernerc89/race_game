In order to run the race_game you need to import the java project into a java code editor.

Before you run the project you need to add the attached track.txt file to your desktop. Once this has
been added you need to replace the file path in the java code to point to your local desktop directory.

If the file exists on your desktop you can run the java project as java application and results will be displayed in the
console.
